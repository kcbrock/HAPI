## __Welcome to the Hawaiʻi Alien Plant Informatics (HAPI) Project__

We are a research project at the University of Hawaiʻi-Manoa compiling and synthesizing all available information on the presence, identity, distribution and invasive traits of alien plants in Hawaii - both cultivated and not. 

## The HAPI Data Portal
We are in the process of designing a data portal, which will be assembled into a user-friendly online format that managers can use to help inform decisions about managing invasive species.

## Share your Data or Expertise with Us
We greatly appreciate anyone who is willing to share their Hawaiʻi plant data to benefit our project.  We're primarily looking for data minimally containing location (ideally GPS coordinates) and an identification to the species level, although some genera-level IDs can be useful for rare plants. Individuals or organizations will be fully credited for the data they provide to us, and plans to make the compiled data available to a select group of researchers and conservationists is currently underway.  Access by the general public is not anticipated in the next one-two years, but we are happy to discuss privacy issues and will notify contributors before changes to access permission take place.

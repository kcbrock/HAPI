# Welcome to the Hawaii Alien Plant Informatics (HAPI) Project

We are a research project at the University of Hawaii-Manoa compiling and synthesizing all available information on the presence, identity, distribution and invasive traits of alien plants in Hawaii - both cultivated and not. 

## The HAPI Data Portal
Ultimately, this information will be assembled into a user-friendly online data portal that managers can use to help inform decisions about managing invasive species.

## Take our alien plant data survey
Additionally, we greatly appreciate anyone who is willing to share their data to benefit our project. Individuals or organizations will be fully credited for the data they provide to us, and plans to make the compiled data available to a select group of researchers and conservationists is currently underway.Â  Access by the general public is not anticipated in the next two-three years, but we are happy to discuss privacy issues and will notify contributors before changes to access permission take place.
